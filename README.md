# HSAudioPlayer

This project has been **Deprecated** in favor of [AudioPlayerManager](https://github.com/tschob/AudioPlayerManager) to better fit the naming convention of Swift.

AudioPlayerManager is a small audio player which takes care of the AVPlayer setup and usage. It uses an internal queue to play multiple items automatically in a row. All path based items which are supported from AVPlayer can be used (MPMediaItems and remote URLs).
